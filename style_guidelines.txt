Design Language for WaitAway


Color Scheme
* Chambray Blue #385C80 (link hover)
* French Pass Blue #BDDEFF

* Darker Malibu Blue #5286BA (gradient)
* Shuttle Gray #5E6F80
* Danube Blue #5A93CC (buttons)


The overall color scheme is chosen as it is because these colors allow for a mature and simplistic look to the website. While a colder color, blue is usually associated with calmness and thoughtfulness. This is in line with the way we expect customers to use our apps: being well prepared and looking ahead.
Malibu Blue will be the main blue, currently used on the front page. Currently, this lists a Darker Malibu blue to be used in gradients. This might be removed and implemented with JS or CSS preprocessing.

Iconography
We’re going for simplistic, minimalist icons for our buttons.
